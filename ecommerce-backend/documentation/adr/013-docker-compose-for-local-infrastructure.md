# ADR-013: Docker Compose for Local Infrastructure

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The e-commerce application requires several external dependencies for local development:
- MongoDB for data persistence
- RabbitMQ for messaging
- Potential future services (Redis, Elasticsearch, etc.)

We need a way to manage these dependencies locally that is:
- Easy to set up and tear down
- Consistent across different development environments
- Suitable for local development only
- Simple to maintain

## Decision
We will use Docker Compose to manage local infrastructure dependencies.

## Alternatives Considered

### Docker (individual containers)
- **Pros**: Simple, direct control over each service
- **Cons**: Manual management of multiple containers, networking complexity, no orchestration

### Kubernetes (local)
- **Pros**: Production-like environment, advanced orchestration
- **Cons**: Overkill for local development, complex setup, resource intensive

### Local installation
- **Pros**: Native performance, direct access
- **Cons**: Environment inconsistency, version conflicts, cleanup complexity

## Rationale
Docker Compose provides the optimal balance for local development:
- **Simplicity**: Single `docker-compose up` command starts all services
- **Orchestration**: Automatic service dependencies and networking
- **Isolation**: Services run in containers without affecting local system
- **Consistency**: Same environment across all developer machines
- **Easy cleanup**: `docker-compose down` removes everything
- **Volume persistence**: Data persists between restarts

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent development environment across team
- Quick setup for new developers
- Easy service management and cleanup
- Network isolation and service discovery
- Version-controlled infrastructure configuration

### Negative
- Requires Docker and Docker Compose installation
- Slight performance overhead compared to native services
- Additional abstraction layer for debugging

## Implementation
- Created `docker-compose.yml` in project root
- Configured MongoDB and RabbitMQ services
- Added persistent volumes for data
- Created custom network for service isolation
- Updated application configuration to connect to containerized services
