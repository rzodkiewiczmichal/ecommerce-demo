# 1. User Story Definition

## Date
2025-02-26

## Context
The project does not require extensive or overly detailed user story definitions. A simple and manageable approach is needed to ensure clarity and maintainability.

## Decision
User stories will be defined in **Gherkin format** and stored in the `requirements/functional` directory within the codebase.

## Consequences
- Uses a **predefined IT standard** (Gherkin) that is widely understood and readable.
- Keeps **requirements and code in sync** by storing them together.
- Enables a **smooth transition to automated E2E tests**, reducing duplication and ensuring test coverage.
